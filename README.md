# AICTE virtual internship project.
Waste Classification Using CNN
📌 Project Overview 

Waste Classification Using CNN is a deep learning-based project that classifies waste into two categories: Organic and Recyclable using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras with ImageDataGenerator for preprocessing.

The project includes a Streamlit app for user interaction and image classification.
